    <h1>First heading</h1>
        <p>This is just a sample paragraph for the first heading. Now lets try some of the old formatting tags. This is a very
        <b>bold</b> word for example. But we can also emphasize it <strong>strongly</strong>. We can also <u>underline</u>
        some of the words if we want to, or also just <i>italize</i> them</p>
    <h2>Second heading</h2>
        <p>Yet another sample paragraph. Here are some incomming site logos.</p>
        <img src="https://s2.olx.bg/static/olxbg/packed/font/2f4f22766be42e5eac379976b5237b92ca.svg"
             width="20%" height="20%" alt="OLX LOGO" />
        <img src="images/software-university-logo-christmas.png" style="background-color: black" alt="SoftUni Logo" />
        <img src="images/piratebay.png" width="15%" height="15%" alt="Pirate Bay lives forever" />
        <p>Now we can demonstrate the <sub>sub</sub> and <sup>sup</sup> Tags. For example we can say that on the
            25<sup>th</sup> of december kids can open up their christmas presents. Or that the Pythagorean theorem states that
        a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>. And instead of typing water, you can write H<sub>2</sub>0. This has
        become quite a long text, better insert a new line now. <br /> There we go, much better. Looks like our work here is
        done. See you on the next exercise!</p>
